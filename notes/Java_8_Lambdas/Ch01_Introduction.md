## Chapter 01: Introduction

- Abstraction is a concept that is familiar to us all from object-oriented programming. The difference is that object-oriented programming is mostly about abstracting over data, while functional programming is mostly about abstracting over behavior. The real world has both of these things, and so do our programs, so we can and should learn from both influences.

- Functional programming is a term that means different things to different people. At the heart of functional programming is thinking about your problem domain in terms of immutable values and functions that translate between them.

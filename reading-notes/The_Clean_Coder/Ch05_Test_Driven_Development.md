## Chapter 05: Test Driven Development

- The three laws of TDD:

	- You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
	- You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to failâ€”and not compiling is failing.
	- You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.

- The unit tests are documents. They describe the lowest-level design of the system. They are unambiguous, accurate, written in a language that the audience understands, and are so formal that they execute. They are the best kind of low-level documentation that can exist.
